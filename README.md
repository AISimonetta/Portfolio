✦ Portfolio Project ✦

Embark on the journey through my very first project, crafted during my immersive full-stack training at _nology. The objective was to craft a distinctive portfolio website, serving as a showcase for all my projects and offering insights into my background. Seamlessly integrating with my LinkedIn account, CV, and GitHub profile, this website provides a comprehensive overview of who I am.
